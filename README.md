# Learning Vue.JS

No matter at which metric you look at (Google Trends, Github Stars, Tweets ...) - VueJS is the shooting star in the world of JavaScript frameworks - it simply is amazing!

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning of the latest version of Vue (Vue.js 3) from the ground up and in great detail.
Throughout my journey of learning Vue, I will look to cover all the core basics and fundamentals of the framework and also dive into advanced concepts like the Composition API introduced with Vue 3.

Frontend frameworks like Vue JS are extremely popular because they give us this reactive, great user experience we know from mobile apps - but now in the browser!

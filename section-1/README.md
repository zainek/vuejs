# Getting Started with Vue
In this section, I explore the what view is and look at a simple example of interacting with the DOM using vanilla JavaScript
and attempt to tackle the same problem using Vue and compare the 2 approaches.

According to the [offical Vue documentation](https://v3.vuejs.org), Vue is an *approachable*, *versatile* and *performant* 
JavaScript framework which is easy to learn and builds on basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge. Is an incrementally adoptable 
ecosystem that scales between a library and a full-featured framework which is 20kb min+gzip at runtime with a blazing fast virtual DOM.

To help myself understand reason why Vue exists, I will explore the following topics:
- What is Vue.js
- Different ways of using Vue
- Exploring Vue alternatives
- Build a simple app using vanilla JavaScript
- Re-build the simple app using Vue and analyse the 2 approaches
